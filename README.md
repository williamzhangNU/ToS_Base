## Key Implementation Features

### Spatial Relationship System
- 8-directional compass system (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
- Agent-centric queries ("left", "right", "front", "back")
- Graph-based relationship tracking

### Action System
- Modular action classes inheriting from `BaseAction`
- Structured `ActionResult` return values
- Text-based action sequence parsing

## Usage

### Basic Import
```python
from ragen.env.spatial.Base import Room, ExplorationManager, RoomGenerator
```

### Room Generation
```python
import numpy as np
np_random = np.random.RandomState(42)
room, agent = RoomGenerator.generate_room(n_objects=5, np_random=np_random)
"""Agent is decoupled from Room."""
```

### Exploration
```python
exploration_manager = ExplorationManager(room)
action_seq = ActionSequence.parse("Move(table); Observe()")
result, info = exploration_manager.execute_action_sequence(action_seq)
```

### Evaluation
```python
from ragen.env.spatial.Base.evaluation import create_evaluation_task

task = create_evaluation_task("direction", room, {"difficulty": "medium"})
eval_manager = EvaluationManager(room, [task])
question = eval_manager.get_current_question()
score = eval_manager.submit_answer("north")
```

## Extension Guidelines

### Adding New Actions
1. Create class in `actions/actions.py` inheriting from `BaseAction`
2. Implement `execute(room, agent)` method returning `ActionResult`
3. Update `ActionSequence.parse()` for text parsing
4. Add to exports in `actions/__init__.py`

### Adding New Evaluation Tasks
1. Create task class in `evaluation/tasks.py` inheriting from `BaseEvaluationTask`
2. Implement `generate_question()` method
3. Add new task to `EvalTaskType` enum in `evaluation/task_types.py`
4. Add configuration options as needed



## TODO
1. Change from single room to multiple rooms
2. Modify action:
    a. visibility of objects: can only see objects in same room; a field of view
    b. add GoThroughDoor action: the action will: move agent to the door; move agent into another room
3. Update exploration manager:
    a. gates are also used in the graph

Storyline:
1. Use different exploration strategies as different agents:
- (Oracle) passive agent with minimal queries: only distance queries --> minimal turns (unreachable lower bounds)
- (Strategist) passive agent with best strtagey --> best turns
- (Inquisitor) passive agent with all necessary queries --> maximum turns
- active agent --> #turns for exploration efficiency
2. Exploration efficiency is reformulated to:
- Advantage over Inquisitor
- Gap between Oracle/Strategist
